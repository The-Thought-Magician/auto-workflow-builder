# AI‚ÄëPowered Workflow Automation Platform

This repository contains a fully‚Äëfeatured web application that acts as a frontend for an AI‚Äëpowered workflow automation platform. Users can describe automation needs in plain language and an AI agent will translate those requests into production‚Äëready workflows using the [n8n](https://n8n.io/) ecosystem. The application also manages user accounts, credentials for third‚Äëparty services, workflow execution history and more.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Chat‚Äëto‚ÄëWorkflow** ‚Äì Users can chat with an AI assistant to describe desired automations. The backend sends the conversation to your configured LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) or another provider) and leverages the n8n API to build workflows.
* **Workflow Management** ‚Äì View all your workflows, toggle their active status, run them manually, clone, edit and delete them. Inspect individual workflows with a read‚Äëonly visualiser, a raw configuration editor and a detailed execution history.
* **Credential Vault** ‚Äì Securely store API keys and tokens for services like Slack, Google, Typeform and OpenAI. Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES‚Äë256 (see `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in your environment). Test connectivity and revoke access from the UI.
* **User & Account Management** ‚Äì Register and log in with JWT authentication. Update your profile and manage your subscription plan (stubbed for future integration with billing providers like Stripe).
* **Dark‚ÄëThemed UI** ‚Äì A modern dark interface inspired by the [Vapi dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/) with animations, transitions and a two‚Äëpanel layout. Built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) for rapid development.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is split into a **backend** and **frontend**, orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for easy deployment. An optional `n8n‚Äëmcp` service is included for advanced AI agent tooling.

### Backend

* **Node.js / Express** server with RESTful endpoints for authentication, chat, workflow management, credential management and user settings.
* **Prisma** ORM with a PostgreSQL database stores users, workflows, credentials and execution logs.
* **JWT** for stateless authentication and **bcrypt** for password hashing.
* **AES‚Äë256 encryption** for credential storage (see `src/utils/crypto.js`).
* **n8n client** (in `src/utils/n8n.js`) wraps calls to your n8n instance‚Äôs REST API. Configure `N8N_API_URL` and `N8N_API_KEY` in your environment to enable creating and managing workflows.
* **LLM client** (in `src/routes/chat.js`) forwards chat messages to OpenRouter or any OpenAI‚Äëcompatible API. Provide your API key via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

### Frontend

* **React** application bootstrapped with **Vite**. Routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.
* **Mantine** component library for a cohesive dark theme, responsive layouts and ready‚Äëmade components (forms, tables, modals, notifications).
* **Framer Motion** brings subtle animations to chat messages and page transitions.
* **Zustand** manages global auth state and persists it to local storage.
* **React Query** handles data fetching, caching and automatic refetching of workflows and credentials.
* **React Flow Renderer** visualises workflow nodes and connections in a read‚Äëonly diagram.

### Docker Composition

The provided `docker-compose.yml` defines four services:

1. **db** ‚Äì A PostgreSQL instance storing all persistent data.
2. **backend** ‚Äì Builds and runs the Express server. It applies Prisma migrations on startup and exposes port `3001`.
3. **frontend** ‚Äì Builds the React app and serves it via nginx on port `3000`. The nginx configuration proxies all `/api` requests to the backend.
4. **n8n‚Äëmcp** ‚Äì Runs the [n8n‚ÄëMCP](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp) server so that AI assistants can access detailed n8n node documentation and management tools. This service is optional but recommended for advanced AI workflows.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Fresh VM Deployment)

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Optional: OpenRouter API key for AI chat functionality

### One-Command Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-workflow

# Start all services (everything auto-configured!)
docker compose up -d
```

**That's it!** The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3030
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5433

### Configuration (Optional)

For full AI functionality, add your OpenRouter API key:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenRouter API key
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-api-key-here" >> .env

# Restart to apply changes
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

### First Use

1. **Open** http://localhost:3030 in your browser
2. **Register** a new account via the signup page
3. **Start chatting** with the AI to create workflows
4. **Manage credentials** for external services (Slack, Gmail, etc.)

No additional configuration needed - database, migrations, and all services are automatically set up!

### Customisation

* **LLM Provider** ‚Äì Change `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL` and provide your own API key in the backend `.env` file to use a different model or provider. The chat endpoint follows the OpenAI `chat/completions` schema.
* **n8n Integration** ‚Äì Point `N8N_API_URL` and `N8N_API_KEY` to your n8n instance to enable creating, updating and running workflows. See the [n8n REST API docs](https://docs.n8n.io/api/) for details.
* **Styling** ‚Äì The frontend uses Mantine‚Äôs dark theme by default. You can modify global theme settings in `src/main.jsx` or replace Mantine with another UI library.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

* **Encryption at rest** ‚Äì Credential data is encrypted using AES‚Äë256 before being persisted to the database. Never commit your `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to version control.
* **Authentication** ‚Äì JWT tokens are stored in local storage via `zustand` persistence. In a production environment consider using HTTP‚Äëonly cookies instead.
* **Production Secrets** ‚Äì Do **not** run this project in production with the example secrets. Always set strong, random secrets and rotate them regularly.

## üìö Further Reading

* The [n8n Blog](https://blog.n8n.io/ai-agent-frameworks/) compares several AI agent frameworks and highlights why n8n is a strong choice for building agentic workflows. It notes that n8n combines visual development with robust integrations and supports memory management, RAG, and flexible LLM selection„Äê929786400724279‚Ä†L466-L584„Äë.
* OpenRouter is an inference marketplace providing access to over 300 models through a single OpenAI‚Äëcompatible API. Developers choose OpenRouter for its ability to route traffic across multiple providers, offering automatic failover and competitive pricing„Äê855525579920782‚Ä†L184-L229„Äë.
* The [n8n‚ÄëMCP README](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp) details available tools for node search, workflow management and validation. It highlights features like smart node search, essential property extraction and workflow validation„Äê793122065525226‚Ä†L540-L601„Äë.
